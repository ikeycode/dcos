D Core OS
---------

Experimental project to learn more about OS theory, while
highlighting the benefits of developing with D, even in a
constrained environment.

### Current state

It's a complete crapshow right now with basic i386/CGA support.
I'll start working towards x86_64 support and enforce use of
framebuffers, including the GOP FB from UEFI.

Don't expect anything from this project, it's scratching a
personal itch!
